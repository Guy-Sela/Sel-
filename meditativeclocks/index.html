        Meditative Clocks is an art collection, made purely with computer code (some refer to this art form as DevArt,
        'Dev' being shorthand for developer/programer).<br><br>

        Each piece can be displayed on any digital screen (from Smartwatch to Times Square billboard), or projected unto
        any surface &mdash; please see illustrations and explanations on each piece under <span
          class="innerBtns">Clocks</span>.<br><br>

        All models are for sale as are, or if you please &mdash; customized, for a tailored experience, and to up its
        collector's value (purchasing a one of a kind piece, or a limited edition collection).<br><br>

        To discuss purchasing options, or if you have any questions, please <span class="innerBtns">contact
          me</span>.<br><br><br>

        <span class="subHeadingInP">How this project came into being</span><br><br>


        Meditative Clocks was born out of a simple programming exercise — build a clock. I thought about it for a while,
        figured out a way to do it, but then thought to myself — wouldn't it be more interesting to build something
        unique? Everybody gets
        the same task and comes up with the same answer — a textbook definition of a clock. The first 'unique' clock
        that
        came to my mind wasn't radically unique. It was simply an Hourglass. I set about programming it, and gradually
        it
        became more and
        more abstract. So much so, that the 'Present' — the flowing sand, usually — disappeared altogether. I liked the
        result. Made it able to flip like a real world Hourglass, and was very proud of myself (this was one of the
        first
        things I
        programmed). It was a one-minute-timer-conceptual-hourglass.<br><br>

        I progressed to making an entire clock out of that one minute timer — Abstract Hourglass. And then kept adding
        new
        models, each with its own unique take on Time. Semi-linear clock, where no moment is ever the same as another;
        The
        Ebb and Flow
        of Time, which is, as far as I know, the most minimalistic clock ever created; Universe clock, which shows, on a
        logarithmic scale, the time since the big bang till now, and the time left till the end of time... ; Present,
        Past
        and Future,
        which breaks the traditional trichotomy of these concepts in a way more compatible with the time of the mind;
        and
        Serendipity on Demand, which is an advanced mindfulness tool.<br><br>

        More models will be created!<br><br>

        Each model can be customized, although I find them perfect out of the box too ;)
        If you'd like a customized version, please contact me.<br><br>

        Innovating on a technology as old as man — timekeeping — isn't trivial at all, If I may say so myself. That
        wasn't
        my original aim — I just wanted a more engaging creative challenge than just programming 'a watch' — but I'm
        glad
        I got carried
        away. While working on these clocks, hypnotized by them for hours, I mused a lot about the nature of time, and
        how
        intimately our conception of time is linked to our conception of life itself.<br><br>

        These clocks are dynamic pieces of art. Timeless. You can spend an eternity with them and never get tired
        (speaking from experience).<br><br>

        So, which one would you like?

      <div class="subSubEls">
        <h1>Present past and future</h1>
        <p>Our subjective grasp of time is very different, often, probably most of the time, from the rigid,
          conventional
          representation of time. A subjective moment is very different from an objective second, or minute. Also, the
          rigid trichotomy
          between past, present and future doesn't apply to the mind. In our minds we wonder between those freely. Note
          that in this watch the past and future are also present, as an homage to this phenomenon of subjective time,
          or
          time of the mind,
          which is also your own personal time. No one else will have the same daily past and future pattern on their
          watch, though the present will be the same for everybody. <em>You'll have to keep an eye on the watch to catch
            the past or future
            resurface or surface and then fade away again.</em></p>

        <h1>The Ebb and Flow of Time</h1>
        <p>
          Probably the most minimalistic clock ever made. Time is represented by a single circle, which, at intervals of
          twelve hours, either expands or contracts. While expanding it gets weaker and weaker, and vice versa. At both
          extremes (12am, 12pm)
          it is completely black.

        <h1>Semi-linear Clock</h1>
        <p>The seconds, minutes and hours are progressing randomly, though always to their usual total of 60 or 24. This
          means that, literally, every moment is unique, never repeating itself.</p>

        <h1>Serendipity (on demand)</h1>
        <p>Serendipity is the happy discovery of something you weren't even looking for. Many scientific discoveries,
          for
          instance, are said to originate in serendipity. There's no need to leave this phenomenon entirely to chance,
          though. There are
          many ingenious ways to get serendipity "on demand". How you connect unconnected dots, is the essence of the
          thing, how your mind turns chaos to order, how you make sense of things. Each time you do that you get an
          invaluable insight, one
          which you could not have get in any other way. People have invented many ingenious ways to invoke this sort of
          serendipity on demand. Freud's psychoanalysis has much of that, Tarot cards, stripped from all mysticism is
          just
          that, lateral
          thinking techniques, and so on.<br><br>

          <em>You will hear a special sound,</em> twice or three times (up to you), every 24 hours. You know that there
          will be two or three sounds per day, but you don't know when exactly they will occur during the day. It is set
          to random and changes
          daily. The sounds, then, connect moments in your life that without the sounds wouldn't have been connected; at
          least not in any way other than the ordinary one which you are used to, and, in a sense, are limited by. This
          is
          a playful way to
          transcend those limitations, a temporary opening to another dimension, to a new meta-perspective each day. Now
          what more can you possibly want from a watch?

        <h1>Universe Clock</h1>
        <p>The small triangle is time passed since the Big Bang. The large triangle is time left till the end of time,
          until the universe freezes, or collapses, or burns out, depending on which theory you adopt. The scale is
          logarithmic (log of 10),
          because there's no other way to depict such magnitude of numbers. This means that the next "pixel" in the
          clock
          will appear in 86,200,000,000 years, as the age of the universe is currently estimated at 13.8 billion years.
          The pixel after that
          will appear at the year 1,000,000,000,000, and the next one at 10,000,000,000,000, and so on. Each time
          raising
          to the power of ten. The big triangle will be full when the universe's age reaches 10 to the power of 1000,
          which is the end of
          time and the beginning of who knows — the big triangle is open.
